/*
Everything in JavScript is an object. 
We create class to create an object. 
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects
We instantiate a class to create an object
##The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, 
##while the object, on the other hand, represents the class
Creating an object from a class is called class INSTANTIATION
*/

//Defining a Class -> CamelCase and {}
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
const person = new Person(); //instantiation -> we use KEYWORD NEW
console.log(person); //Person {}
